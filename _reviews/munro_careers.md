Munro Careers is a career coaching service based in Buckinghamshire led by Karen Munro, a professionally qualified career guide.  After finding myself in a bit of a dead-end with my job seeking, an ex-colleague who previously had success with Karen’s methods recommended her services.

Since I began looking for a new role late last year, I had been sending off my CV with little success.  Despite my wealth of experience at world class organisations and having a range of technical skills, I received very few responses and even fewer invitations to interview with prospective employers.  The lack of feedback was frustrating.  It was clear that my CV was not doing enough to make it onto hiring managers’ shortlists.

Over two conversations, Karen patiently listened to understand my career needs.  She then followed up by outlining the services she could offer to help improve my chance of getting my noticed in this tough job market and age of AI screening tools.  

I decided to use the offline CV review service.

The critique of my CV was both professional and honest.  Karen provided me with direct, actionable feedback to help me reshape my CV and highlight how my experience aligns with the roles I am apply to.  As a result, I am now sending out tailored CVs that give me a much greater confidence in how I am presenting my skills to prospective employers.  I’m looking forward to starting a new role soon.

Munro Careers offers a range of career services – not just CV reviews.  If you are looking to make a change in your career, why not book a free consultation conversation today?
