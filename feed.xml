For example:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on the person’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.[66] This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person, or an older person who is suffering. [67] It also underpins the tradition of human rights (and, in particular, what are now called “neuro-rights”), which represent “an important point of convergence in the search for common ground”[68] and can, thus, serve as a fundamental ethical guide in discussions on the responsible development and use of AI.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Considering all these points, as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word ‘intelligence’” in connection with AI “can prove misleading”[69] and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person. In light of this, AI should not be seen as an artificial form of human intelligence but as a product of it.[70]</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p><strong>Further Reading</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_et_nova">Wikipedia - Antiqua et nova</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="AI"/><category term="ethics"/><category term="philosophy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Dicastery for Culture and Education have released a co-issued doctrinal note entitled Antiqua et nova (Ancient and new).
