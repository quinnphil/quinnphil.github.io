[The Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/) (FSA) has a simple mission: Make sure food is safe and what it says it is.  Established in 2000 following high-profile outbreaks of foodbourne illness such as BSE (mad cow disease), this independent, non-ministerial department works across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to protect public health from risks arising from the consumption of food and generally to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food.

The FSA offers a number of open datasets available to use for free.
[FSA - Data](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets)

The Food [Hygiene Ratings Scheme (FHRS) dataset](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/38dd8d6a-5ab1-4f50-b753-ab33288e3200) gives the food hygine rating or inspection results given to a businesses and date of inspection or visit by the local authority.

Using this dataset I built the following map to explore FSA ratings of local businesses in my area.
